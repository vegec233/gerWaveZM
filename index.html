    <h1>The importance of trigonometry in computer graphics</h1>
    <p>Trigonometry is an essential part of computer graphics because it provides a means of representing and manipulating geometric transformations, which are fundamental to rendering 2D and 3D scenes.</p>
    <p>In 2D graphics, trigonometry is used extensively to calculate the positions of points, lines, and curves.In 3D graphics, trigonometry becomes even more important. The process of rendering a 3D scene
       involves projecting a 3D world onto a 2D screen, which requires a deep understanding of how to manipulate 3D objects in a 2D space. Trigonometry is used to calculate the position and orientation of 
       3D objects in the 2D space, as well as to calculate lighting and shading effects.</p>

    <h1>The importance of understanding 2D shapes in computer graphics</h1>
    <p>Understanding 2D graphics is also crucial as it provides the foundation for understanding how 3D graphics work. The principles of 2D graphics, such as coordinate systems, transformations, and rendering 
       techniques, are all essential building blocks for understanding how 3D graphics work.</p>

    <h1>Reasons for creating this site</h1>
    <P>Therefore, it is important for students who are learning computer graphics to have a solid understanding of trigonometry and 2D graphics before moving on to rendering 3D scenes. Which is why this website
       is created.
